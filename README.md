# Why This Project
Accurate electric load prediction is essential for efficient power system operation, planning, and sustainable energy management. While the integration of renewable resources and the complexities of modern grids demand smarter solutions, traditional forecasting approaches often lack adaptability and predictive depth. This study addresses this gap by developing and evaluating robust machine learning models—Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest—for short-term electric load forecasting using real-world temporal and weather-related data. The research emphasizes comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering from time series, and systematic model optimization with advanced techniques like RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Rigorous assessment through statistical metrics such as 
R
2 , mean absolute error (MAE), and mean squared error (MSE) demonstrates each model’s strengths and weaknesses in practical scenarios. The results highlight the Random Forest model’s superior forecasting accuracy, driven by its ensemble nature and flexibility in capturing nonlinear patterns. Visualizations of loss curves and prediction scatter plots provide actionable insights into model behavior and generalization. By leveraging these predictive analytics, utilities and policymakers can make proactive, data-driven decisions to meet dynamic demand, improve resource allocation, and support the transition toward more resilient, sustainable power systems. Ultimately, this work showcases how modern machine learning can deliver precise, transparent, and scalable solutions for the evolving challenges of electric load management.
